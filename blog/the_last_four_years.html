        <h1> The Last Four Years </h1>
        <h2> Andy Tseng</h2>
            <p> The last four years have been amazing. I broke past the barrier and landed a job at a large tech company as a software engineer.
            I moved to Seattle and realized how great of a city it is. From public transportation, weather (lol), and just having a great team to work with, I am 
            very forunate. My goals for the short term are to be more social and continue to learn more about the tech industry. Being in the belly of big tech means 
            I have the chance to be exposed to important information. I guess this could be seen as an opportunity to learn how the world works.<br> <br>

            Amidst my political journey, I was radicalized into being a socialist/communist during the summer of 2021. This was when George Floyd was murdered by the state.
            Two months after, I began reading about policing and how the police are inherently racist from the inception of America. As I began reading Marx and Engels, I 
            saw the pitfalls of capitalism and American imperialism. The wounds that capitalism sows runs deep within everyone within America. Everyday I can see how hurt
            some people are at work, on the bus, or from online.  <br> <br>

            Before the covid pandemic, I would consider myself a "Bernie bro". After a disappointing 2016 democratic party
            primary, I was left with some despair on what to do next. Slushing around, I watched a bunch of random YouTube videos. A person that I came across that inspired
            me greatly is Michael Brooks. Brooks was a cohost for the Majority Report with Sam Seder and Jamie Peck. He had an amazing way to describe conflicts around
            the world in a Marxist sense. There is a really popular video of him answering the occupation of Palestine by Israel. <br><br>

            For my short term goals I plan on: 
                <ul>
                    <li>Read more books</li>
                    <li>Work on video game</li>
                    <li>Hit Challenger in TFT</li>
                    <li>Meet more people</li>
                    <li>Go to the gym (lol)</li>
                </ul>

                Long term goals:
                <ul>
                    <li>buy a house ... </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </div>
